This is a coding challenge by hivemind https://github.com/HivemindTechnologies/scala-coding-challenge adjusted for Elm.

Run just by using `elm reactor`.

I set up the project as if it was to grow bigger. 
For something this small there would be no point in setting up design system (`Ui/` part),
elm-ui's elements could be used non-wrapped just with custom styles.

I did not style the elements. They are left with `TODO style` comment
but they are wrapped and prepared for that in the above-mentioned `Ui/` folder.

I left some comments in code hinting why I used a particular approach
Projectwise this would be better served in a separate coding style document
as e.g. config builder pattern is used in many places so explaining it
in on neither all the places is suitable.
